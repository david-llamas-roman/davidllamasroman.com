## üíª More details about website
### Website Type
- **Web App**

  This is a web app, because we have 2 database in it (1 SQLite and 1 MariaDB) and we have an API with which we can access and manage databases data. After, the data that we extract through the API is showed in the frontend. If the main objective of the website will be catch clients and we will not need any database, any API (because we search, for example, redirect to an external app), the website type will be 'Landing Page'.

### Sections
- **Home**

  In this section, it will show an 'intro' and some links to see one section or other.

- **About me**

  In this section, it will show a text that have as main objective introduce myself and help to people to meet me better.

- **Projects**

  In this section, it will show all my projects and relevant info about them.

- **Experience**

  In this section, it will show all jobs and work positions that I have been.

- **Academy**

  In this section you would find some free courses about technologies in which I have a good level. The videos will be uploaded in YouTube and, here, will be the text version of course and the video embedded.

- **Get in touch**

  In this section you would find a chat to talk with me, but do not by any reason. Only, for example, if you want to tell me something about a work issue, about a side or personal project that you have, about my content... I think that you understand the type of messages that I expect to receive.

- **Licenses**

  In this section, it will show all licenses under which the website and its content are licensed.
