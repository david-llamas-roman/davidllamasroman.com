## üíª More details about website
### Website Type
- **Web App**

  This is a web app, because we have a database in it and we have an API with which we can access and manage the database data. Then, the data we extract through the API is displayed in the frontend. If the main objective of the website is to attract clients and we do not need any database, any API (because we search, for example, redirect to an external app), the website type will be 'Landing Page'.

<p align="center"><img src="./frontend/public/img/dlr.svg" alt="dlr logo" width=100></p>

The logo reflects my evolution both professionally and personally.
- The squares that form the 3 steps of the staircase represent the plan I have always followed to become who I am today. This figure is typically associated with acting thoughtfully and analyzing the situation carefully.
- The staircase symbolizes my growth in the profesional field. It is normally related with the progress and development.
- The fonts used for the acronym (DLR - David Llamas Rom√°n) are different to represent my personal evolution and the changes in my mindset over time.
