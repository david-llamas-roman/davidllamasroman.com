## üíª More details about website
### Website Type
- **Web App**

  This is a web app, because we have a database in it and we have an API with which we can access and manage the database data. After, the data that we extract through the API is showed in the frontend. If the main objective of the website will be catch clients and we will not need any database, any API (because we search, for example, redirect to an external app), the website type will be 'Landing Page'.

### Sections
- **Home**

  In this section, it will show an 'intro' and some links to see one section or other.

- **About me**

  In this section, it will show a text that have as main objective introduce myself and help to people to meet me better.

- **Projects**

  In this section, it will show all my projects and relevant info about them.

- **Experience**

  In this section, it will show all jobs and work positions that I have been.

- **Academy**

  In this section you would find some free courses about technologies in which I have a good level. The videos will be uploaded in YouTube and, here, will be the text version of course and the video embedded.

- **Get in touch**

  In this section you would find a chat to talk with me, but do not by any reason. Only, for example, if you want to tell me something about a work issue, about a side or personal project that you have, about my content... I think that you understand the type of messages that I expect to receive.

- **Licenses**

  In this section, it will show all licenses under which the website and its content are licensed.

### üìÅ Database

### ‚öô Backend

### UI
I want to create something different, I do not want to have the same design as most websites. However, the idea that I have in my mind is difficult and not implemented in one or two days. Therefore, I will implement a simple UI and update it little by little. In this section of the README, you can find all changes that have been made in the website UI.

#### Logo
<p align="center"><img src="./frontend/public/img/dlr.svg" alt="dlr logo" width=100></p>

The logo reflect that I started out as a nobody and, over the time, I have evolved to become in the person that I am today. Always following a plan.
- The squares that constitute the 3 steps stair represent the plan ("Always following a plan"). That figure is normally related with the fact of do something squarely (thinking carefully).
- The 3 steps stair represent the grow that I have in somethings related with me like my profesional career or my content creator career. That object is normally related with the grow.
- The fonts of the acronym (DLR - David Llamas Rom√°n) are different, because represent my personal evolution. I started, for example, with a closer mind (therefore, I chose a serif font, more classical) and, over the time, I have evolved to become in the person that I am today literally (therefore, I chose 2 san-serif fonts. One more futurist than the other).
