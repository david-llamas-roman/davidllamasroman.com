        <p data-key="first">I hate the pre-established. I do not want to be a 'normal' employee, I do not want to have a 'normal' salary and, of course, I do not want to stay with my arms crossed seeing as my dreams vanish. Now, I am going to mention the things that I want to. I want to work hard to learn and to get going experience quickly to get the best work position that I can imagine, I want to fight per my dreams and, why not, I want to live the life too. As you can see, I am not never satisfied with nothing and, sincerely, I have never endured that there are people who do it.</p>

        <p data-key="third">Hi, I am David Llamas RomÃ¡n and I am a very normal man who wants to do something different which marks a before and after in the actual society. Therefore, I am hard working in my personal brand. Perhaps, everything that I have done so far has not had such an incredible and idyllic result, but Rome was not built in a day. I am sure that that day will arrive.</p>
        <!-- 4 -->
        <p data-key="fourth">Meanwhile, I am in a constant and permanent learning. To finish this presentation, I will use a serie of words. Hard working, discipline and never surrender.</p>
